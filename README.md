# Gesture-detetction-glove
This project presents the design and development of a sensor-equipped glove capable of translating sign language into spoken or written language in real time. This wearable device utilizes flex sensors to track the position, movement, and orientation of the userâ€™s fingers and hand. These sensors collect data on hand gestures, which are processed by an onboard microcontroller that matches each gesture to a database of known signs. The glove wirelessly transmits this data to a connected smartphone or computer, where it is converted into text or audio output, enabling effective communication with non-sign language users.
The glove addresses key challenges, including gesture accuracy, real-time responsiveness, and ease of use, through features like machine learning integration and haptic feedback for gesture confirmation. This technology has the potential to bridge communication gaps, offering a portable and accessible solution for real-time sign language interpretation in social, educational, and professional settings.
